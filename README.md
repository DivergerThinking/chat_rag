# Retrieval Augmented Generation Document QA

Working PoC for a QA Document with LLM (RAG) pipeline implementation in notebooks. The pipeline covers the following processes:
1. Pre-process CSV dataset
2. Creates a VectorDB and loads CSV dataset with metadata
3. Creates a Retriever able to query the VectorDB and reason over the retrieved data
4. **Extra**: Implements a chatbot able to use the retriever as a tool (agent) interatively


# Installation:

Before launching the notebooks it is needed to install the module. Just run the following comand on your terminal:
